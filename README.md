# DCF-Valuation
I have performed a DCF valuation to determine the intrinsic value of TCS equity. 
BSE Sensex30 was used as a reference to calculate the beta for the CAPM model.
Future cash Flows were forecasted using the ARIMA time series model.
Financial statements were used to calculate the cost of debt.
All necessary data was taken from Yahoo Finance, the BSE website, the RBI website, and investello.com.
